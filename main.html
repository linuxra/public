Octopuses are truly remarkable and fascinating creatures of the ocean!</p></div>
  <div class="grid-item">The <strong>First Part </strong>establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration. It states that if a function 
    f
    f is continuous on a closed interval 
    [
    a
    ,
    b
    ]
    [a,b] and 
    F
    F is an antiderivative of 
    f
    f on that interval, then the definite integral of 
    f
    f from 
    a
    a to 
    b
    b is equal to 
    F
    (
    b
    )
    −
    F
    (
    a
    )
    F(b)−F(a). In simpler terms, it shows how to compute a definite integral.</div>
